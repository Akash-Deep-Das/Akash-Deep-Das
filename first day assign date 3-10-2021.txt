Q;-The Between notebook editors IDE And Code Editors?

ANS:-ide:-The term "IDE" comes from Integrated Development Environment. It is intended as
 a set of tools that all work together: text editor, compiler, build or make integration, debugging, etc. ...
 An editor is simply that, a tool that is designed to edit text.

2.notebook editor:- notebook interface (also called a computational notebook) is 
a virtual notebook environment used for literate programming, a method of writing 
computer programs in a way that more closely matches how humans think. ... Modular 
notebooks may connect to a variety of computational back ends, called "kernels".

3.code editor:-A code editor is nothing but a text editor that is
 specialized for writing software. It may be a stand-alone program or 
part of an integrated development environment (IDE). They make writing and
 reading the source code easier by differentiating the elements, so the programmers 
can view their code.
