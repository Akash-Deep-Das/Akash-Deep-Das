Q)Difference between let and var in javascript?

ANS:-Difference between let and var keyword


var keyword


The var statement is used to declare a variable in JavaScript. A variable declared with the var keyword is defined throughout the program.

Example
var greeter = "hey hi";  
var times = 5;  
if (times > 3) {  
   var greeter = "Say Hello JavaTpoint";   
}  
console.log(greeter) //Output: Say Hello JavaTpoint  
Output:

let and var keyword


let keyword


The let statement is used to declare a local variable in TypeScript. It is similar to the var keyword, but it has some restriction in scoping in comparison of the var keyword. The let keyword can enhance our code readability and decreases the chance of programming error. A variable declared with the let keyword is limited to the block-scoped only.

Note: The key difference between var and let is not in the syntax, but it differs in the semantics.
Example
let greeter = "hey hi";  
let times = 5;  
if (times > 3) {  
   let hello = "Say Hello JavaTpoint";   
   console.log(hello) // Output: Say Hello JavaTpoint  
}  
console.log(hello) // Compile error: greeter is not defined  
Output:


The above code snippet throws an error because the variable "hello" is not defined globally.
